                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>This course is designed to challenge the way that you think.</li>
                    <li>In the early days of computer programming,
                        computer programmers were free to create any set of instructions that would solve a problem
                        and were free to choose which
                        <abbr title="Programming Language">PL</abbr>
                        they would use to program
                    </li>
                    <li>In today's computer prgramming market, we expect programmers to learn several computer languages
                        in a career.</li>
                    <li>This course is desidgned to teach the common skills used by all programmmers in all Programming
                        Languages.
                        The <strong>flowchars and pseudocode are the primary tools we will use in this course</strong>
                    </li>

                <h1>Computer Programs</h1>
                <p><dfn>Programming</dfn> is the development of a solution to a problem. a
                    <dfn>computer program</dfn>
                    is a set of instructions that,when directed through ccomputer hardware, produces results.
                    <strong>Design a solution to the program first, desk check this solution, and then code the program
                        in a chosen programming language.</strong>

                <h1>Designing a program</h1>
                <p>The process of designing a program can be summarized in following two steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand the task that the program is to perform.</li>
                    <li>Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Understand the task that the program is to perform</h2>
                <p>It is essential to understand what a program is supposed to do before you can determine the steps
                    thhat the program will perform.
                    The programmer studies the information that was gatherdf from the problem and creates al ist of
                    different software requirements.
                </p>
                <h2>Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task</h2>
                <p>after completing the first step, begin by breaking dowan the task into a series of steps.
                    This is an example of an
                    <dfn>algorithm</dfn>, which is a set of well - defined logical steps that must be taken to perform a
                    task.
                    for example, you want to design a program to add up a list of prices on a pocket calculator. to
                    solve this problem we can make a task list.
                </p>
                <ul id="example-task-list">
                    <li>Turn on calculator</li>
                    <li>Clear calculator</li>
                    <li>Key in dollar amount</li>
                    <li>Key in decimal point (.)</li>
                    <li>Key in cents amount</li>
                    <li>Press addition (+) key</li>
                    <li>Repeat the aboves four steps until all prices have been entered</li>
                    <li>Write down total price</li>
                    <li>Turn off calculator</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Task list falls in the category of informal logic plan. In creating a task list, you can first solve
                    the provlem by hand and then record the steps you took to solve the problem.
                    We can create a formal logic plan by using techniques as:flowchart, psuedocode, and coputer program.
                    In this course, we will focus on using flowchart and psudocode.
                </p>
                <h1>Desk Checking</h1>
                <p>Desk checking ensures our project is correct.
                    We will produce somesample data and work throuhg the solution by hand to see if we get the right
                    answer . It is important to complete this step to ensure that the answer is correct.
                    For instance, if a car achieved 35 Kilomeres per litre, we would asssume that your program was
                    incorrect, regardless of how you designed the program.
                </p>
